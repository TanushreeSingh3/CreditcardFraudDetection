# CreditcardFraudDetection



This repository contains the code and resources for a machine learning project focused on credit card fraud detection using logarithmic regression. The goal of this project is to develop a model that can effectively identify fraudulent credit card transactions, thus preventing customers from being charged for unauthorized purchases.

About the Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains information about credit card transactions, including various features associated with each transaction. The dataset is labeled, indicating whether each transaction is fraudulent or legitimate. This labeled information serves as the basis for training and evaluating the machine learning model.
